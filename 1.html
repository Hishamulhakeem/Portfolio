<p>Mandya, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, with a</p>
<p>current CGPA of 7.5.</p>

<p>Over the past few years, I’ve gained strong foundation and hands-on experience</p>
<p>in Python, JavaFX, and SQL, along with deep understanding of core AI and ML </p>
<p>like Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Natural Language Processing, and </p>
<p>Engineering. I’m passionate about using these technologies to create solutions</p>
<p> that are both intelligent and impactful.</p>

<p>During my academic journey, I completed two internships — one as an AI Intern and</p>
<p>another as a Data Science and Analytics Intern — which gave me hands-on experience </p>
<p>model development, data handling, and real-world implementation of AI systems. </p>
<p>Additionally, I completed a 3-month AI internship, where I gained exposure to </p>
<p>applications of AI. This helped me strengthen my technical expertise while developing</p>
<p>a professional and collaborative mindset. Beyond academics, I believe strong </p>
<p>adaptability are key strengths. I can speak five different languages, which allows</p>
<p>me to connect with diverse teams and understand different perspectives — an essential</p>
<p> skill in global tech environments.</p>

<p>Outside of studies, my hobbies play a big role in shaping my personality — chess </p>
<p>my strategic thinking, swimming builds focus and discipline, and the gym has taught</p>
<p>me the value of resilience and consistency.</p>

<p>In short, I’m a curious learner and a problem-solver who thrives at the intersection</p>
<p>of technology and innovation — always eager to learn, build, and contribute meaningfully</p>
<p>to the AI-driven future.</p>
